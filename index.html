My definition of philosophy is to think out all the views of the universe and of man's place in it, which scientific hypotheses should entail. Therefore I get to take part in the thinking. But it's not just armchair thinking: it's implementing what we believe to have <i>proven</i> possible. </p></div><div class="content"><a name="coding">coding</a><div class="section-line"><hr></div><p>I've had some experience coding. I really enjoy doing it. I find myself coding until 4am sometimes. The only other thing that I've done until 4am and enjoyed doing was talking with a friend or two about Grigoryan chants, religion, and anime. And there aren't many friends to do that every weekend... Anyways, here are some coding projects I've done, for companies or with smaller groups. </p><div bg="darla" class="text-bg"><p><h3><a href="http://darla.dartmouth.edu">darla.dartmouth.edu </a><div class="label">(Ongoing, Winter 2015-)</div></h3>I built a website for a pair of Dartmouth professors for linguists to upload audio/text files for further linguistic analysis. We have servers running in Apache and lighttpd. I used python (via the webpy library) to write the static server-side code. I also wrote bash and cron scripts to run the linguistic analysis files for batch processing. </p></div><div bg="wonder" class="text-bg"><h3><a href="https://www.makewonder.com">Wonder Workshop </a><div class="label">(Summer 2016)</div></h3>I pulled, cleaned, then stored data from Wonder Workshop's Android and iOS apps into a postgreSQL RDBS. I made queries to track overall application usage across different pivots (os platforms, device sizes, and calculated user demographics) as well as user behavior within the application to help drive content revision/bug fixes in the apps. I created a website written in NodeJS + Typescript to display some of the data. The dashboard is <a href="http://metrics.makewonder.com">viewable</a> for those with authorization (i.e. part of the Wonder Workshop team). </div><div bg="heartstring" class="text-bg"><p><h3><a href="http://www.heartstring.life">Heartstring </a><div class="label">(Spring 2016)</div></h3>I and a few other programmers teamed up with Dartmouth business school students to work on Heartstring, a music-discovery app that unites video and sound. It is an app that allows users to take videos/multiple photos and pick different track clips to best accompany the shots. I implemented the Google Cloud Vision API to guess the facial expressions in the shots and match them to music in the app's existing library. I also initiated the move from housing the music files in-app to storing them in a Firebase database.  </p></div><div bg="gr" class="text-bg"><p><h3><a href="http://girlrising.com">Girl Rising </a><div class="label">(Winter 2015)</div></h3>I helped build an internal staff website application for Girl Rising that allowed for self-hosted resources and statistics, increasing organization and file-versioning. We housed metadata with MongoDB and stored files in AWS S3 buckets. I worked full-stack on this application, with server written in Scala and client with the AngularJS framework. What I really enjoyed about this experience is that while building the application, I got direct feedback from my coworkers for improvement on features we implement. I even got to use the application myself after collecting demographic research for the company's film launch in India.</p></div><div bg="streamline" class="text-bg"><p><h3> <a href="http://streamlinehealthcare.com">Streamline Health </a><div class="label">(Summer 2014)</div></h3>As a software developer intern, I designed modules for a web-based application that manages Electronic Health Records for physicians, running on the Microsoft SQL Server and .NET framework. I got full stack development experience, building in C# and using Microsoft Visual Studio for the front end. </p></div></div><div class="content"><a name="quotes">quotes</a><div class="section-line"><hr></div><p>I collect lots of quotes!
