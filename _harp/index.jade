		hr
		p I graduated from Dartmouth College as a Computer Science and Philosophy major in 2017, and now I work at Facebook. For me, the motive of philosophy is to think out all the views of the universe and of humanity's place in it, and decide what should we do to be better humans. Accordingly, the goal of computer science is implementing things that we want to do to be better humans. My goal is to not forget how closely these two objectives align: it's easy to both get lost in code and lost in thoughts.

		p I've had some experience coding. I really enjoy doing it. I find myself coding until 4am sometimes. The only other thing that I've done until 4am and enjoyed doing was talking with a friend or two about Grigoryan chants, religion, and anime. And there aren't many friends to do that every weekend... anyways, here are some coding projects I've done, for companies or with smaller groups.

				i Using Computational Models to Understand ASD Facial Expression Recognition Patterns, &nbsp;
				| I applied two computer vision techniques to try and classify a dataset of facial expressions: I extracted Gabor Jet features coupled with LDA, and also used a convolutional neural network. I manipulated both of these models to see whether I could verify hypotheses of how individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder see faces.

				| BoomSync was a product of a 12-hour hackathon with friends. It is an interactive game in each level teaches people with the knowledge of javascript basics to code asynchronously. There are various levels, starting from executing a function immediately, to creating callbacks, making promises, and also dealing with rejections. We used the React framework (the designs were made by my friend in Illustrator) to create the game.

				| I built a website for a pair of Dartmouth professors which allows linguists to upload audio/text files and receive further linguistic analysis on the audio, such as vowel formants. We have servers running in Apache and lighttpd. I used python (via the webpy library) to write the static server-side code. I also wrote bash and cron scripts to run the linguistic analysis files for batch processing.

I made queries to track overall application usage across different pivots (os platforms, device sizes, and calculated user demographics) as well as user behavior within the application to help drive content revision/bug fixes in the apps. I created a website written in NodeJS + Typescript to display some of the data. The dashboard is

				| I and a few other programmers teamed up with Dartmouth business school students to work on Heartstring, a music-discovery app that unites video and sound. It is an app that allows users to take videos/multiple photos and pick different track clips to best accompany the shots. I implemented the Google Cloud Vision API to guess the facial expressions in the shots and match them to music in the app's existing library. I also initiated the move from housing the music files in-app to storing them in a Firebase database.

					.label (Winter 2015)
				| I helped build an internal staff website application for Girl Rising that allowed for self-hosted resources and statistics, increasing organization and file-versioning. We housed metadata with MongoDB and stored files in AWS S3 buckets. I worked full-stack on this application, with server written in Scala and client with the AngularJS framework. What I really enjoyed about this experience is that while building the application, I got direct feedback from my coworkers for improvement on features we implement. I even got to use the application myself after collecting demographic research for the company's film launch in India.

I got full stack development experience, building in C# and using Microsoft Visual Studio for the front end.

		hr(style="border-top: 2px solid #ddd;")
		p Besides music, I like hiking and climbing. Being from Illinois and going to New Hampshire for school makes one always in awe of mountains. My goals for the next year are to complete a 10b climb without falling, lead climb, and to hike Mt. Washington. My goals for life are Mount Blanc and Mount Fuji.
